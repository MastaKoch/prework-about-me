      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After watching a documentary called "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix, I realized that the people in the tech field have a duty to make sure that technology advances in an ethical manner. The way our data is being used across social media platforms really intrigues me. I hope to become a web developer to gain a better understanding of how these platforms work so I can one day develop my own platform. Ultimately, I want to make the world a better place for everyone who has access to technology.</p>
